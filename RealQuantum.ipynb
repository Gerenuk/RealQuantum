    "# Quantum mechanics with simple real vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum mechanics is usually formulated with a wave function which requires complex numbers, spin vectors which require Pauli matrices, operators which are needed to determine outcome probabilities and a Hamiltonian operator which determines the time evolution. I will examine if quantum mechanics can actually be done with simple real vectors from high-school, the usual dot product and a rotation of vectors. None of the previously mentioned mathematical objects will be needed. This reduced complexity will reveal a geometric meaning to quantum mechanics.\n",

    "To transform a wave function to a real vector we use the density matrix for a pure state. The operation that we usually apply to the density matrix is $P=\\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho A^\\dagger)$ for some matrix $A$. It can be identified with an inner product in a real vector space as follows:\n",

The expression $P$ becomes a dot product $P=\\Psi\\cdot A$. However, if all our matrices are Hermitian matrices $H_{ij}=H^*_{ji}$, we can continue and create a real vector space, due to the redundancy of the matrix values opposite of the diagonal.\n",
