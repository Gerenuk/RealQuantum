    "# Quantum mechanics with simple real vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum mechanics is usually formulated with a wave function which requires complex numbers, spin vectors which require Pauli matrices, operators which are needed to determine outcome probabilities and a Hamiltonian operator which determines the time evolution. I will examine how much of quantum mechanics can actually be done with _simple real vectors_ from high-school, the usual dot product and a rotation of vectors alone, without using any of the previously mentioned mathematical objects. This reduced complexity will reveal a geometric meaning to quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code is be provided to apply and validate the results, which I will extend sometime. While I assume that the overall computational cost does not desrease (and neither increases), this simpler representation may form a more intuitive way to think about interpretations of quantum mechanics.\n",

    "# Wave function as a real vector\n",
    "\n",
    "To transform a wave function to a real vector we use the density matrix for a pure state. The operation that we commonly will apply to the density matrix is $P=\\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho A^\\dagger)$ for some matrix $A$. It can be identified with an inner product in a vector space as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P=\\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho A^\\dagger)= \\sum_{ij} \\rho_{ij} A^\\dagger_{ji} = \\sum_{ij} \\rho_{ij} A_{ij}^*$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we identify the wave function with a column vector $\\Psi=(\\rho_{11},\\rho_{12},\\ldots)$ and the other matrix with $A=(A_{11},A_{12},\\ldots)$ we already get vectors in a complex vector space. The expression $P$ becomes a dot product $P=\\Psi\\cdot A$. However, if all our matrices are Hermitian matrices $H_{ij}=H^*_{ji}$, we can continue and create a real vector space, due to the redundancy of the matrix values opposite of the diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P=\\sum_i \\rho_{ii}A_{ii}+\\sum_{i<j} \\left(\\rho_{ij}A^*_{ij}+\\rho_{ji}A^*_{ji}\\right)\\\\\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we can just stack the diagonal values and the real and imaginary parts of the off-diagonal values into an $n^2$-dimensional real column vector to do the same calculation with a dot product only.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boxed{\\Psi=\\left(\\rho_{11},\\rho_{22},\\ldots,\\rho_{nn},\\sqrt{2}\\Re(\\rho_{12}),\\sqrt{2}\\Im(\\rho_{12}),\\sqrt{2}\\Re(\\rho_{13}),\\sqrt{2}\\Im(\\rho_{13}),\\ldots\\right)}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "$$P=\\Psi \\cdot A$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability to measure a certain eigenvector $|\\lambda\\rangle$ of an observable can be calculated by using $A=|\\lambda\\rangle\\langle\\lambda|$ in our expression which is like an obserable with eigenvalue 1 for our desired eigenvector and 0 for all other orthogonal vectors. Therefore converting this the same way into a real vector $\\Lambda=|\\lambda\\rangle\\langle\\lambda|$ we can write for the probability of measuring a quantum state in another measurement state\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boxed{P(\\lambda)=\\Psi \\cdot \\Lambda}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation has a much more natural and geometrically interpretable form than $|\\langle \\psi|\\lambda\\rangle|^2$. Later we will see that other needed quantum mechanic operations are simply rotations of these real vectors. Note that it calculates the measurement probabilities, whereas the measurement outcomes (eigenvalues) are treated separately."

    "5. Immediately after the observable has yielded a value $\\lambda$, the state of the system is the normalized eigenstate $|\\lambda\\rangle$\n",
    "6. The evolution of the system is described by $|\\psi(t)\\rangle=U(t,t_0)|\\psi(t_0)\\rangle$ for some unitary operator $U$.\n",

    "In the alternative formalism introduced here we instead have\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At each instant the state of is system is completely represented by a vector $\\Psi$ (in **real** vector space)\n",

    "3. The only possible result of a measurement is the values that you **independently assign to the observable vectors**.\n",

    "5. Immediately after the observable has yielded a value $\\lambda$, the state of the system is the normalized eigenstate $\\Lambda$\n",
